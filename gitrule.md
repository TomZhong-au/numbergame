hello everyone, I think it is very dangerouse that everyone can make a pull request
to the main branch and then merge it without any review.

I change the rule to that pull request to merge to main could only be approved with 3 reviews.

Actually I mean reviewed by 2 other team members, plus the member who make th PR request, makes it 3.
